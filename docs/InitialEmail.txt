Briefly, I’d just like to explain a little bit about the company. The Cake Lab is a specialist cakes and confectioneries company which focusses on using the science of premium raw ingredients to create innovative, yet delicious products for retail outlets as well as bespoke catering. Science is core to our philosophy, as all our products are created by scientists who are passionate about good food. Through mixing art and science, we are able to produce beautiful, delicious cakes and confectioneries. 
 
The company was based on other cake companies such as IVCC (https://www.lvcc.co.uk) and Don’t Tell Charles (https://www.donttellcharles.com.au). Web site design was based on Net-A-Porter (https://www.net-a-porter.com). The aim is to create a user friendly website which is exquisite, minimalistic and chic.  
 
Once you’ve had a chance to do an initial draft would it be possible for you to teach me how to maintain the site? i.e. change/ delete photos and update text?
